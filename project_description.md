# Project Description

This project is a Pharma Bill Extraction system built using Python, OCR, and PyQt5.  
It processes pharma invoices (PDFs), extracts structured medicine and billing information,  
and exports clean CSV files. The system supports OCR for scanned PDFs, regex-based extraction,  
bill-type detection, and a full GUI for user interaction.
